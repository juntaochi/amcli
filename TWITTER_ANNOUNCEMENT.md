## Sample Replies to Common Questions

**Q: "Does it work with Spotify?"**
A: Not yet! Phase 5 (plugin system) will add Spotify, VLC, and Last.fm. For now it's Apple Music only via macOS integration.

**Q: "Why Apple Music only?"**
A: Started with Apple Music because of tight macOS integration via AppleScript. Plugin architecture is coming in Phase 5 to support multiple players!

**Q: "Will there be a Linux version?"**
A: Considering it! The core is player-agnostic. Would need to integrate with D-Bus (MPRIS) for Linux players. Contributions welcome!

**Q: "How's the performance?"**
A: Blazing fast! Async Rust + Tokio means UI never blocks. Artwork and lyrics load in background. Sub-10ms frame times on M1.

## Notes

- Keep tone enthusiastic but not salesy
- Emphasize the "retro aesthetic" angle (it's unique!)
- Mention it's v0.1.0 (shows honesty, sets expectations)
- Link to GitHub early and often
- Use 1-2 emojis max per tweet (don't overdo it)
- Include code blocks for installation (highly shareable)
